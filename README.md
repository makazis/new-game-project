so, a factorio based game, with liquids n stuff (but why not solids? If we have a line of production, like a conveyor belt, anything can overflow it)

Liquids:
- Neothol (blue) is the base liquid for whole operation as it can extract subliquids from other primary liquids [is volatile liquid] || other factories want to buy this - you get primary machinery (not so specilized or advanced just the base)
- Primer (green) is the liquid with healing properties and regenrative [is sludge like] || pharmatictic companies and scientis would like to buy products from this - you get advanced liquid machinery (better equipment like centrefuge and mixers)
- Weldijum (gray) is the liquid of metals, we don't know how it can morph into so many but we don't care [is hevy and mercury like] || building companies as well as metal factories would like to order products from this - you get better piping and liquid transfers methods (underground pipes, faster pipes and pumps)
- Rokorijum (red) is extremly spicey and suprisingly wery tasty [is bit dry and powder like, yet beeing liquid] || food companies would like to buy these - you get wires (better electrical wires, can wistand higer powers)
- Kulijum (yellow) is extremly reactive and seems to about to explode and slightest tuch [is very watery and glisening] || electrical companies and reactor companies would like to buy this liquid products - better generators (biger wolts, multipliers, ac generators)


So, how about we add mixing liquids to make new liquids, not just getting them into barrels, and the goal of the game is to get all of the liquids themselves, before blowing your factory up, and you have a counter of unique liquids and you can in fact sell them, but you need to put each one of them into a special place for them to be sold (previously placed on the map), and you have a little shop where you can buy new parts
