so, a factorio based game, with liquids n stuff (but why not solids? If we have a line of production, like a conveyor belt, anything can overflow it)

Liquids:
- Extractium (blue) is the base liquid for whole operation as it can extract subliquids from other primary liquids [is volatile liquid] || other factories want to buy this - you get primary machinery (not so specilized or advanced just the base)
- Primer (green) is the liquid with healing properties and regenrative [is sludge like] || pharmatictic companies and scientis would like to buy products from this - you get advanced liquid machinery (better equipment like centrefuge and mixers)
- Weldijum (gray) is the liquid of metals, we don't know how it can morph into so many but we don't care [is hevy and mercury like] || building companies as well as metal factories would like to order products from this - you get better piping and liquid transfers methods (underground pipes, faster pipes and pumps)
- Rokorijum (red) is extremly spicey and suprisingly wery tasty [is bit dry and powder like, yet beeing liquid] || food companies would like to buy these - you get wires (better electrical wires, can wistand higer powers)
- Kulijum (yellow) is extremly reactive and seems to about to explode and slightest tuch [is very watery and glisening] || electrical companies and reactor companies would like to buy this liquid products - better generators (biger wolts, multipliers, ac generators)
